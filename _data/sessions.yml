  title: "PHP7 And Beyond: The Future of PHP"
  description: "PHP is experiencing a renaissance; old methodologies are everywhere under assault from advances in tooling and design. From Composer to HackLang, “the PHP way” of solving problems is dramatically evolving. Walls between projects are falling; interoperability and collaboration are happening on levels never thought possible. What do these accelerating changes mean for the future of the language? What might PHP8 look like? How will our communities continue to collaborate and evolve? And most pressing: what steps can we take to ensure PHP’s continuing vibrancy in the face of future technical challenges?"
